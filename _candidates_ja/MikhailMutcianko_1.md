IntelliJ IDEA is an extensible platform for code editing and analysis. We hope to provide more flexible API for extending this functionality even further. This workshop will be dedicated to exploring the ways to implement extended support for various libraries or compiler plugins in Scala for intelliJ IDEA, and will be most interesting for library writers or simply Scala enthusiasts willing to hack IDEA platform.
