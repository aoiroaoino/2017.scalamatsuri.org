Come share your stories at Scala Matsuri 2017!

We are excited to announce that the fourth Scala Matsuri will be held on February 25th and 26th, 2017 at Tokyo International Exchange Center. Please submit your sessions and save the dates on your calendar. This CFP will be closed on **Sunday, November 20th 24:00 JST**. (7:00 Pacific, 10:00 Eastern in US)

Matsuri, meaning festival, is about time and space out of the everyday. Itâ€™s about mustering up the courage to do something cool (even though we are normally shy).
We want to make it a fun experience, regardless of gender, race, and many different backgrounds.
All participants, including speakers and sponsors, are asked to be respectful to each other and follow the [code of conduct](/en/code-of-conduct/).

In particular, we want to make it a fun event for those visiting Japan from overseas.
So here are some of the things we will do this year:

- CFP in English and Japanese < you are here
- Speakers will be decided using survey as a reference
- All slides in English
- Separete tracks for presentations in English and Japanese (with a few exceptions possible)
- Professional interpreters (English/Japanese bidirection) in two main halls
- Travel support for speakers with most votes (*up to* $2000 USD)
- Organize groups to hang out at bars after the conference if you're up for it

We are looking for topics that you think Scala community would be interested. We have two session length: 40 minutes and 15 minutes. Prepare an abstract of your talk (600 characters or less), and submit your proposal.

We'll conduct a survey on which talks your fellow Matsuri would want to go to,
and the organizers will decide the talks using the survey result as a reference.
In addition to the CFP, we might invite a few speakers to make Matsuri more fun experience.

You are allowed multiple submissions. However, please note that it might end up splitting your votes,
and that we'll ask you to select one talk even if multiple talks qualified via the survey.
