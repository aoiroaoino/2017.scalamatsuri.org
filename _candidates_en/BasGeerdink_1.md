ING is a Data Driven Experimental Enterprise, which is heavily investing in big data, analytics and streaming processing. As in many other enterprises, we deal with a large variety of data sources. Some are responsible for primary processes, while others are used to improve the quality of the service and to keep internal operations going on smoothly. In this talk, Bas will share an overview of the architecture and projects at ING that have Scala and Spark at its core. You will explore lessons learned, best practices and code!
