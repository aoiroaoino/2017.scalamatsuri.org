In this session, weâ€™ll create an application for predicting life events with machine learning technology. A few slides with a common process and AI theory will be our starting point. Next, we'll walk through the architecture and source code of a predictive analytics system, created with Scala and Spark. Join if you want to have an overview of a data science project from start to go-live!
