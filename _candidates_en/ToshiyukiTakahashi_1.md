I will talk about an example of application design taking advantage of Scala which is a hybrid language of object-oriented approach and functional programming. I will also present how Scala's language features and techniques can be applied to issues such as how to separate side effects, describe dependency between components and their lifecycle, keep domain models pure and manipulate them.
