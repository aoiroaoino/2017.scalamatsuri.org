In this session, I will give an example of an application design that takes advantage of the hybrid language of object-oriented approach and functional programming that Scala provides. I will also present how Scala's language features and techniques can be applied to problems such as how to separate side effects, describing dependency between components and their lifecycle, and keep domain models pure and manipulating them.
