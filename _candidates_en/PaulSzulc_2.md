For me, functional programming was never about switching paradigms just to switch. It was always about sanity. Yes, sanity. The ability to finally do real engineering (to some extent). A safe space where you can reason about your code in isolation. Where modularity actually makes sense. 

Free monad is a concept that forges that idea into practical solution. It allows you to reason about your concerns in isolation and combine them together on a higher level. Programs written with Free are very comprehensible and maintainable (once you know how Free works).
