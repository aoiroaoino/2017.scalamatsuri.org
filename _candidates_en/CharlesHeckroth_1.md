Roping in Complexity, Decay, and Duplication in a Growing Scala Project:

Lehman's Laws of software evolution state that as a system evolves, "its complexity increases unless work is done to maintain or reduce it", and that a system "must be continually adapted or it becomes progressively less satisfactory".

I will cover my own process of spotting decaying components of our system, and how my team and I apply functional programming concepts to grow our system without wide-spread, un-maintainable complexity growth.
