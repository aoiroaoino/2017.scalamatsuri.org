"I want to do product development using Scala!"

As a professional programmer, I spend most of my time developing products at work.
Wouldn't it be nice if we could use Scala at our day jobs?

After many proposals and attempts at laying the groundwork, I was finally able to get my work to adopt Scala and even sponsor ScalaMatsuri.

In this session, I would like to share my process for the adoption of Scala in a non-top-down way; detailing what I explained and emphasized to management and other departments to convince them to support the adoption of Scala.

Examples:
- Let's introduce Scala so it's advantageous for engineering XYZ!
- How to get project managers on your side for Scala adoption.
- How to get your employer to sponsor ScalaMatsuri.
- How to get other members of your team involved in studying Scala.
