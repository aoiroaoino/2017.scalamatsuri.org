"I want to do product development using Scala!!"

As a professional programmer, I spend most amount of my time in developing the products at work.
Wouldn't it be nice if we could use Scala at our day jobs?

After many attempts of laying the groundwork and proposals, I was finally able to get my work to adopt Scala and even sponsor ScalaMatsuri.

In this session, I would like to share my process towards the Scala adoption in a non-top-down way: What I explained and emphasized to the management and other departments so they can be conviced and supportive.

Examples:
- Let's introduce Scala so it's advantageous for engineering XYZ!
- How we can get project managers on our side for Scala adoption.
- How to get your employer to sponsor ScalaMatsuri.
- How to get other members of your team involved in studying Scala.
