Finch (a Scala combinator library for building HTTP endpoints) is rapidly approaching 1.0 and while its design keeps evolving, the core principles are still the same as in 0.1. In this talk, we'll walk through Finch's only abstraction, an Endpoint, and discuss why building an HTTP API in terms of functional combinators is a reasonable idea that promotes an insane level of reusability. We'll see that functional abstractions and APIs don't necessary trade off performance, but could easily be orthogonal to it.
