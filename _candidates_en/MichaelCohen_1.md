I've seen all walks of Scala engineers and an equal number of companies using the tech-stack. Learning/Growing the technology is typically of primary importance to it's users, but beyond advancing the stack - what is it being used for in the real world and what does the future hold for the Scala community?

I've interviewed heads of engineering from; Foursquare, Spotify, Gilt Groupe, Morgan Stanley, S&P Global, etc. on how they're using the stack, what they like about it, troubles they're facing and with their input have put together some ideas for helping the stack/community in the future.
