In 1991 Erik Meijer et. al published "Functional Programming with Bananas, Lenses, Envelopes and Barbed Wire." This paper is a classic one, widely recognizable in the FP community. Constructs described - known as recursion schemas - have real world applications. Strictly speaking, explicit recursion is the ‘goto’ of pure functional programming.
This talk is about generalization of a very specific recursion schema (called catamorphism) over fixed point data type Fix.
