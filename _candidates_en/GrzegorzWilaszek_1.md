Concurrent programming in Scala is much easier due to functional design and monadic context of Futures or similar structures. However, we may benefit from more declarative composition of asynchronous tasks. I will explain a type-level, Shapeless based approach to seamless, declarative and type driven composition that works for any monad and is particularly useful for the asynchronous ones. Weâ€™ll see how it was applied to implement an asynchronous dependencies injection library for Akka that is type-safe, declarative, functional and sorts out futures handling in actor model.
