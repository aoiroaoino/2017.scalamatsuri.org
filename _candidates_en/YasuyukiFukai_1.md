Using a JDI (Java Debug Interface) tool as an example, I will show how to create a Graphic User Interface (GUI) application using ScalaFX.
JDI is an API used to monitor and control the execution of applications by setting up break points and showing classload events.

In this session, we will implement a GUI application using ScalaFX that retrieves test coverages via JDI.
