The Internet of Things is a broad technolgy field. There lots of interesting use cases and upcoming technologies to dive into. This session focusses on the 'back-end' of IoT solutions. After all, all this data has to be processed effectively to be truly meaningfull. For demonstration purposes, a software solution was created with Spark, Kafka and Cassandra to demonstrate these data flows. Join this session to get an overview of a fullblown Scala analytics application according the lambda architecture and reactive manifesto, and to get inspired to set up your own predictive IoT solution!
