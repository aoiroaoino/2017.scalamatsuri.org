In my previous talk I showed one way of using Word2Vec for recommending similar items.  In this talk I’ll take it further by introducing different ways to use Deep Learning for recommendation systems. The talk will cover the basics for using DeepLearning4J and Scala on GPUs. I’ll also demonstrate how to train a model with some sample data. Finally, I’ll present ways you can deploy it in production. The talk will be light on math but full of code and demos.
