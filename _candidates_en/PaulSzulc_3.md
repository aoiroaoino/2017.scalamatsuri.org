Being in a Scala community, you've probably heard about type classes. Very basic concept that both commonly used among many Scala libraries and at the same time very fundamental to understand any theoretical concepts behind Functional Programming. This short talk is all about explaining what Type classes are, how to use them and how to create them, with strong emphasis on answering the question "why should I even care?". We will focus on both on prons and cons, however speaker will probably be a bit biased towards the former.
