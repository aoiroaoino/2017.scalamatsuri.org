As cloud platforms are starting to provide Function as a Service (FaaS), such as AWS Lambda, we are seeing the emergence of Serverless Architecture, which no longer requires server administration as part of infrastructure operation.
How does the Serverless Architecture work with Scala?
Serverless design and functional programming languages like Scala are considered to have conceptual commonalities and we feel that they have high affinity when used together.
One of the frameworks that can be used to easily get started with Serverless Architecture is called Serverless Framework and it officially provides a template using Scala and sbt.

There won't be anything difficult in this session.
I will explain the best practices of using AWS Lambda with Scala while also going over the basics of Serverless Architecture and ServerlessFramework.
