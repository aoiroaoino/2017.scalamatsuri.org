As cloud platforms are starting to provide Function as a Service (FaaS), such as AWS Lambda, we are seeing the emergence of the Serverless Architecture, which no longer requires server administration as part of infrastructure operation.
How does the Serverless Architecture work with Scala?
It is considered that there are conceptual commonalities between the Serverless design and functional programming languages like Scala, and we feel that they have high affinity together.
One of the frameworks to get started with the Serverless Architecture easily is called ServerlessFramework, and it officially provides a template using Scala and sbt.

There won't be anything difficult in this session.
I will explain the best practices around using AWS Lambda with Scala while going over the basics around the Serverless Architecture and ServerlessFramework.
