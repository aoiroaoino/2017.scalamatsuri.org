This talk is about using Scala as a playground to better understand logic and category theory.

We'll start introducing recursion schemes by playing with fixpoint types.
Then, moving from value level recursion to type level recursion, we'll see how our newly acquired skills can also apply by implementing some of the data structures provided in Shapeless.
