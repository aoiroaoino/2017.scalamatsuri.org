In this session, we will share lessons learned from developing a new service from scratch and launching it using Scala. We will introduce examples of the problems and solutions to utilizing libraries and tools in both the backend service (such as Finatra, Finagle, Pants, IntelliJ and Aurora) as well as in the frontend (such as cooperation with iOS/Android mobile applications).
