How difficult can it be to build a Scala team from scratch?

Starting from how to introduce Scala tn your organziation to growing and hiring new members: this talk is an experience report of our ongoing experiment about things that worked and things that did not work for us.

The goal is to give you a good idea of what you are up against when starting a new team.
