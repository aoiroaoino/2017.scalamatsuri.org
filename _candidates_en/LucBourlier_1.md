The latest generation of tools for the Big Data are written in Scala. And the APIs for these tools are inspired by the Scala collections.
By comparing the Scala collections API and the APIs of Spark, Flink and Kafka Streams, we will see how knowing the Scala collections allows you to start programming Big Data applications.
And then, we will go a bit further, looking at how the APIs were extended, to provide all the operations needed by Big Data applications.
