This is a "from zero to hero" light talk. Preferable audience are people who want to: 

1. understand any shapeless/scalaz/cats presentation out there (this presentation will give you ability to survive first 10 minutes of mentioned talks) 
2. be enlightened that "monads are just type classes with some laws" (this is not a monad tutorial though) 
3. get the "aha!" moment, realising that they've been using Type classes from time to time, without knowing it
