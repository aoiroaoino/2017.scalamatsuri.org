You might be familiar with the following situations:
"I want to do X, but what library in Scala should I use?"
"I know of library Y, but how can I use it?"

In this session, we will introduce the libraries we used to build an actual internal API.
The purpose of this session is to share our knowledge around what features we used, what we liked, and when to use what.
I hope this session can reduce the barriers around Scala adoption and help to promote it in various cases.

Examples: sbt, Finagle, scrooge, Specs2, ScalaCheck, ScalaMock, scalafmt, scalaz
