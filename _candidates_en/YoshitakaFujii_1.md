In this time, I challenged to build a Serverless Architecture based system throughly in Scala.
I develop sbt-plugin that connects AWS API Gateway and Lambda together in optimal combination leveraging these features.
I also would like to introduce some of the important tips utilizing asynchronous processing in Scala to connect Kinesis with Lambda in the Serverless Architecture system.
